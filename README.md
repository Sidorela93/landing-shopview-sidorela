## üì© Contact Form Implementation ‚Äì Summary & Validation

### ‚úÖ 1. Contact Form Section

- Uses the POST method and submits to itself to simulate a backend process.
- Fields included:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Message
  - Consent (required checkbox)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1ce79ae-f2d1-48d7-b625-609f89645d15)
Located in sections/contact-form.php

Submitted via POST to contact-form.php and returns a confirmation message.

Validation included.

### ‚úÖ 2. Form Submission Simulation
- After form submission, a confirmation message is shown with user input.
- Fully tested and functional in a local XAMPP environment.

### ‚úÖ 3. Google Tag Manager Placeholder
- A placeholder GTM snippet is added in `head.php`:
```html
<!-- Google Tag Manager (Placeholder) -->
<!--
<script>(function(w,d,s,l,i){w[l]=w[l]||[];w[l].push({'gtm.start':
new Date().getTime(),event:'gtm.js'});var f=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],
j=d.createElement(s),dl=l!='dataLayer'?'&l='+l:'';j.async=true;j.src=
'https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id='+i+dl;f.parentNode.insertBefore(j,f);
})(window,document,'script','dataLayer','GTM-XXXXXXX');</script>
-->
<!-- End Google Tag Manager -->
```
- Ready to be activated by replacing `GTM-XXXXXXX` with the actual GTM ID.

### ‚úÖ 4. GA4 Event Tracking
- A `gtag()` event listener is added in `contact.php` for form submission:
```html
<script>
  document.querySelector('form').addEventListener('submit', function () {
    if (typeof gtag === 'function') {
      gtag('event', 'form_submit', {
        'event_category': 'Contact',
        'event_label': 'Contact Form',
        'value': 1
      });
    }
  });
</script>
```
- Requires `gtag.js` to be initialized in `head.php` (add real tracking ID if needed).


## üïí Time Spent
- ~10‚Äì12 hours to convert the Figma design into a modular, responsive, working layout with form integration and tracking simulation.
